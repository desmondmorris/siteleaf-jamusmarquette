A SiteLeaf theme for the [website](http://www.jamusmarquette.com) motion and graphics designer, Jamus Marquette.

This original site was built in 2008 in CakePHP.  I decided to convert to SiteLeaf partially as an experiment and mostly to remove the necessity of managing a VPS to host it.

## Requirements
* [SiteLeaf gem](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-gem)

Fork this repo and clone in to your local machine.  Then run `bundle install`.

## Usage
* **Build Assets** - `rake jm:build`
